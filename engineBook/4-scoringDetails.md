## Scoring Table
| Scoring                                   | Points (PT)  | Win Points (WP) |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Each ball *scored* in a *goal*            | One (1) PT   | Zero (0) WP     |
| Each row *owned*                          | Six (6) PT   | Zero (0) WP     |
| Full *Home Row* after *Autonomous Period* | Zero (0) PT | One (1) WP       |

### Autonomous Period
A fifteen second (0:15) time period during which Robots operate and react
only to sensor inputs and to commands pre-programmed by the Students into the Robot control
system.

### Win Points (WP)
The first basis of ranking Teams. Teams will receive zero (0), one (1), two (2) or three (3)
Win Points for each Qualification Match.
- One (1) WP is awarded at the end of the Autonomous Period for any Team in an Alliance earning the Autonomous Win Point.
- Two (2) WP are awarded for winning a Qualification Match.
- One (1) WP is awarded for tying a Qualification Match.
- Zero (0) WP are awarded for losing a Qualification Match.

## Possible Goal Scenarios

### Figure 2.1
This *Goal* is *owned* by the Blue Alliance, as the top-most *Ball* is completely within the upper edge of the *Goal*

### Figure 2.2
This *Goal* is owned by the Red Alliance, as the top-most *Ball* is not completely within the upper edge of the *Goal*. The top red *Ball* is *Scored* because it is below the upper edge of the *Goal*.

### Figure 2.3
This *Goal* is owned by the Blue Alliance, as the top-most *Ball* is not completely within the upper edge of the *Goal*. The two bottom-most *Balls* would both be considered *scored*, as they are partially within the outer edge of the *Goal*.

### Figure 2.4
If this situation occurs at the end of a Match, this *Goal* would still be *owned* by the Blue Alliance, and the top-most *Ball* would be *Scored*, even though it is not completely within the upper edge of the *Goal*. No penalty is assessed to the Red Alliance.

## Scored Ball
A *ball* is considered *Scored* in a *Goal* if it is not touching a Robot of the same color as the Ball and meets all of the following criteria
    - The *Ball* is fully or partially within the outer edge of the *Goal*.
    - The *Ball* is fully below the upper edge of the *Goal*
    - The *Ball* is not contacting the foam tiles outside of the *Goal*.

## Owned Goal
A *Goal* is considered *Owned* by an Alliance if its colored *Ball* is the vertically
highest *Scored Ball* in that *Goal*. 

## Autonomous Bonus
A point bonus of six (6) points awarded to the Alliance that has earned the most
points at the end of the Autonomous Period.

## Autonomous Win Point
One (1) Win Point (WP) given to an Alliance that has completed their Alliance
Home Row at the end of the Autonomous Period. Both Alliances can earn this WP if both Alliances
complete their Alliance Home Row.
