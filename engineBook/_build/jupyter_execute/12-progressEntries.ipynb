    "Today we started generating ideas for change up. We created design matrices to compare many different drive bases and robot designs. We decided to continue developing 2 of the drive bases in CAD so we could work with them.\n",
    "We also started to come up with basic strategies for both skills and competition matches. These strategies helped make a decision on what type of robot we wanted\n",
    "Started to work on 2 different drives bases that we wanted to compare together. \n",
    "One is a direct-drive mecanum base that is 6 sections long, and 7 sections wide. We had to make this base 7 section wide to accommodate the wide mecanum wheels and the future tray that will go in the drive base.\n",
    "The other drive base is an omni wheel drive base geared 32:84 with 600 rpm motors for an output speed of 257 rpm, we are using this high speed to make up for the lack of strafing that the mecanum drive base has. This base is is 6 sections wide and 7 sections long, which is a better sized drive base for maneuverability but might cause some problems with the future attachments such as tray and intakes\n",

    "Today was mostly spent in CAD as we continued to improve the mecanum drive base. We added a 6 bar lift to the back of the drive base powered by 2 motors and running at a 32:64 gear ratio. We do not know what motor speed this motor will be running at because we do not have a physical robot to test different speeds on. We went with a six bar lift because we can mount the lift a lot lower on the robot compared to a 4 bar lift, but it will still reach the 18.3in goals to score in. \n",

    "Today we completed the CAD of the mecanum drive base robot. We connected a simple 2 stage tray to the 6 bar lift that will unfold using rubber band tension and the force of a ball moving up the tray.\n",
    "The tray can currently hold 6 balls, we believe there is no reason to hold more than six because of the limited number of balls on the feild and how each goal can hold 3 balls. When holding 6 balls the last ball is only half in the tray and the first ball is in the intakes\n",
    "We also added intakes to the 6 bar, these will passively unfold at the start of a match by falling down on a hinge using gravity. The intakes are currently very close to each other at 6.5in. This might cause a problem when intakes balls when we build this robot but because we only have a CAD model we can not test this. \n",
    "The intakes are sticking out of the robot ~2.5in so when we go to de-score balls from the bottom of goals the robot does not interfere with the intakes and block it from reaching the balls\n",
    "Today we also worked on the 257rpm omni drive base. We added a third middle wheel to the drive base, powered off the back motor. This will improve weight distribution across all the wheels and also allow us to “lock” the center wheel meaning we can not be pushed. We would lock the wheel by putting screws in the omnis rollers so it can not move side to side\n",
    "We also started to connect a six bar lift to the robot, we are having problems finding a way to connect the six bar in a way that does not interfere with the center wheel, or any of the other wheels. Because of this the six bar is not connected to the robot fully. The main problem is that unlike the mecanum drive base, this drive base has the six bar lift mounted over the wheels because of its width. In the future if we want to continue using this drive base we need to either move the 6 bar inward away from the wheels, or make the drive base wide.\n",

    "Today we worked on only the 257rpm omni drive base as the mecanum was completed the previous day. We did find a way to mount the full six bar onto the drive base but it is a lot higher than we would like. Because of this we have not yet put on intakes or a full tray. The tray that we did connect is almost a good place but is still too high. This height is also a problem for the intakes as the intakes have to fit inside the bottom of the goals to descore balls. Because of these current issues we will most likely be redesigning this drive base to more closely match the mecanum drive base in the future\n",
    "Today we worked on getting pseudocode for the robot. This included creating classes for the critical functions of the robot, and starting to program odometry. We looked at 7K’s code as an example as they were the number one skills team for tower takeover. We ended up talking with them to get a better understanding of how odometry worked. \n",
    "Because we are now using odometry in code, we need to add position trackers to the robot, for this we are using 2.5in omni wheels that have been cut in half to save space, connected to hollowed out c-channels with optical shaft encoders on them. The c channels are attached to the robot at only one point so they are free to rotate, we will be using this to our advantage so we can use a rubber band to tension the trackers to the ground. Below is a list of all the classes that we came up with that we will begin working to create. \n",

    "Today we changed the mecanum drive base cad to have omni wheels similar to the second drive base we had. We did this because the other drive base with omni wheels was having complications with adding the intakes and tray. When we added the omni wheels where the mecanum were, we could make the drive base less wide by 4 holes.\n",
    "Our two other inertial sensors came in today so we were able to test and begin understanding 7K’s odometry better. They use 3 different inertial sensors, one for the left set of wheels, one for the right set of wheels, and then a 3rd as backup. Now that we have 3 inertial sensors we will be able to continue understanding 7k’s odometry and begin writing our own odometry and try to improve upon their odometry.\n",

    "We began creating the GUI for our robot. We will have multiple pages, Auton selection, Sensor values, and a reset page. The Auton selection page will have a 3x3 grid of buttons that resemble the goals on the field. The idea behind it is that depending on our teammate and game plan we will choose exactly which goals we want to score in during the pre auton. Then to the left we will have two buttons for our most common autonomous runs, and a drop down above them to choose which side we are on either Blue or Red. Underneath all of that we will have a clear button in case when choosing the goals we click the wrong one and a start button which will start the auton. In between these two buttons we will have little boxes that light up to show the progress of how many goals we checked.\n",
    "To create all of this we used LVGL. We created a button matrix for the 9 goals, a drop down object for the drop down menu, 4 button objects for the preset autons, and the clear and start buttons, and finally 3 checkbox objects for the progress bar. We also discussed how we will do movements autonomously. We know that we want to move the robot on arc paths but currently do not know how to implement this, so further research on how to implement arc paths is needed. Below there is a photo of our current GUI. Below that are the current member functions in the Display class. These functions are what we run during the initalize phase to load the GUI and select things such as the autonomous routine. \n",

    "We wanted to improve the GUI by making it cleaner and have a nice background. Our background now is a galaxy background behind the buttons and then a picture of the field for the auton 3x3 grid. The matrix we had yesterday was made invisible and the buttons moved to positions of each goal according to the picture. The picture of the field also changes based on whether the drop down menu is selected as Red or Blue. When you select one of the goals in the 3x3 it draws a green circle around that goal so it's easy to see which ones have been selected.\n",

    "Because of how important the autonomous phase is now, with the extra win point as well as the fact people are already maxing out the driver skills score, We want to improve our code as much as possible. We are implementing PID, slew rate control, and Odometry into our code for driver and autonomous to improve the consistency. Currently we have a Chassis class, Slew class, and a Display class.(Chassis for drive base member functions, Slew for slew rate control member functions, and Display for LVGL GUI member functions.)  The main two member functions of the Chassis class are drive and turn. The drive member function uses a PD (Proportional, and Derivative) loop that takes the average of the left and right tracking wheels to go to the given position, and uses slew rate control to accelerate up to max speed. The turn member function is similar to the drive member function in using a PD loop with slew rate control but instead of the tracking wheels we are using the average of three inertial sensors that face the North, East and West directions of the robot. We use the average of three because basing it on one will get more and more inaccurate over time whereas three sensors help mitigate that problem.\n",

    " Today the old CAD was redone and finished, with all the problems we were previously having we started over completely with a new drive base and intake system. \n",
    "The new drive base uses 3.25in omni wheels as they are closer to the ground so our intakes have more room above the wheels and will not interfere with each other. The wheels are geared 60:36 at 200rpm for an output rpm of 333rpm. This output rpm is slightly faster than our old drive base but the smaller wheels will give us more control at this speed.\n",
    "The new intakes swing out at the start of a match to ~5.15in outside of the 18in restriction or ~6.9in from the front of the robot (measured from the start of the drive base) This will give us enough space to start lifting the balls up in our robot quicker than before allowing us to put the drive motors in a normal place unlike our previous designs.\n",
    "Along with that the new intakes consist of 2 parts that are chained together, the first part can go fully into a goal to start descoring while the other moves the balls in to the rest of the robot, the chain that connects the two parts of the intake is laid in a way that it can go around the goal posts and will not get caught\n",
    "The new indexer/ball tower system has been redesigned to fit in with the new front intakes, It starts sooner on the robot so the motors do not have to move to a different location and is also protected from the goal by pieces of c-channel. The main difference between the old and new systems is that on the back of the robot, we now have two extra rollers that allow us to get rid of balls that we do not want by spinning the intake in reverse. We have also added a vision sensor to the front of the robot with future plans to automate this function. \n",
    "Programing of the new robot\n",
    "We have kept the inertial sensors and tracking wheels from the old drive base in the new robot so we can continue to develop those systems\n",
    "We have added a vision sensor to hopefully automate the sorting of balls. Whenever we start scoring on a goal the vision sensor can detect the goal and switch to manual sorting mode.\n",

This page is to help debug and will not be needed to be used in competitions since all the motors and sensors get reset at the beginning of the program so this will mainly be used to debug the robot during practice.\n",

The front intakes have been working well but there is a slight problem with the rubber band “hook” on the intakes as it interferes with the center goal post. We can move this easily and it should not be a problem for very long. Unfortunately our main problem with the intakes is that the right intake seems to have a lot of friction compared to the left one. More testing need to be done to find out the cause of this problem as the motor seems to be fine. Along we these problem the intakes can not fold up into size requirements right now because there is a piece that need to be cut and we currently can not do that.\n",

We also redid the slew code for the drive base and implemented a basic P loop that gets the difference of the current joystick position and the current output of the robot it then determines whether it needs to add or subtract to get to the target value and then adds/subtracts the given amount that the human inputted into the member function.\n",

It knows what color is the opposing color by having the use input which alliance they are on and then the robot uses that information to know which color to look for. The robot autosorts by running two member functions of the intake class. First it runs autoSort() then the bulk of the autosorting is done by Intake::calculateSort(int opposingColor). The autosort member function is a switch statement that takes the global variable int Alliance which stores whether we are on the Red or Blue alliance and based on its value will pass a different value into the calculateSort member function. Then the calculateSort function actually takes a snapshot with the vision sensor and checks it for the opposingColor and if found it will run the intakes to send the ball into the back of the robot. \n",

While making the gear ratio 1:2, it was the worst out of the three. Our next approach was changing the curve of our hood. We tried having the hood bend upward at the end of it which turned out to fix the problem we were having. TWhile this hood does do a good job at scoring the balls, it does have a hard time supporting itself and also starting in the size requirements. Next week we are going to redesign the hood so it meets all of these requirements.\n",

    "Today we solely focused on improving our hood. We began by redoing the way it connected to the robot as the old design was weak and in the way. The new design has the hood connect to the two c-channels that create the back tower of our robot. Since we mounted it this way, it also able to fit inside the top roller for an easy and consistent starting position. Our new hood is almost completely flat. To help with keeping constant pressure on the ball, we put 1.5\" spacers at the end of it to give it just enough of an arc that would give the ball just the right amount of pressure.\n",

    "### Autosort Function\n",
    "Since we got VEX’s new optical sensor that can sense the color of objects, we decided that we wanted to use that instead of the vision sensor since the sensor is more compact and is more efficient at detecting color than the vision sensor. Since the sensor currently does not have support in PROS we began testing it in VEXCODE. Since we implemented the sensor we are able to now remove the bottom line sensor since now when we index balls we can use the optical sensor to stop the ball and the bottom line sensor is redundant. Since the optical sensor might not be supported in PROS by the time of our first competition on 11/21/20 we will probably not be using this feature and stick with normal auto indexing. But we will continue developing and perfect it so when it becomes supported we will be ready to implement it fully. Below is the current working autosort function.\n",

    "We are very happy with the way our robot is right now, so we decided that today was our last editing day and that starting next tuesday we will begin practicing again in preparation for our competition. Our goals for this competition are to win Tournament Champion, Skills, and Excellence if possible. We are confident that if we practice enough that we will be more than able to do this with our current robot. \n",
    "#### Practice Goals\n",
    "For Pre-auton, we want a program that will be able to fill our home row. We want this because if we can fill the home row in every match we will get a lot of extra Win Points which will help us rank high. \n",
    "For Autonomous Skills, if time allows, we will improve upon our home row pre-auton by either trying to fill the rest of the goals or by filling only a couple rows but also removing the blue balls from them.\n",
    "For Driving Skills, Our goal is to get at least 100 points and then begin trying to get the max score by descoring all the blue balls too\n",

    "### Auto Sort Function\n",
    "Last thursday (10/29/20) PROS pushed a new kernel update that supported the optical and distance sensors so we were able to port over our code we created in VEXcode to our actual program. When we ported it over, we also increased the speed at which the intakes and rollers run so it is much faster now. We also created a new function for sorting when we are interacting with the goals. The code is a simplified version of the normal auto sorting but with a few differences. The main one is that it no longer checks to see if it found the right color, it only checks for the enemy color. Upon finding the enemy color it will reverse the top indexer to send the enemy ball out the back of the robot. Another change to it is that instead of stopping the ball at the top line sensor, it spins is all rollers to score the balls in the goals. The way this works is that it will be scoring all the balls and upon finding the enemy color it will eject that out the back of the robot and then immediately continue scoring.\n",

    "With the auto sorting, we had a problem with the ball going past the top line sensor. We had been trying to fix it by lowering the speed of the top indexer but this just made the problem worse. The actual problem wasn’t the timeframe to sense the ball but actually the speed difference between the top and middle rollers. Since the middle ones were faster than the top, it would cause a weird anomaly where the ball would idle for a little bit and move backwards and then when it would go up to the line sensor it would not be able to sense the ball. To fix this all we had to do was make both the middle and top rollers spin the same rpm. \n",
    "We also had an issue with the enemy ball cycling all the way through in both the auto sorting and the goal sorting. To fix this we added a second optical sensor and lowered both of them to be right behind the back of the intakes. This now allows the balls to be read very early and more accurately since both sensors are very close to the balls when they enter. Even if a ball comes in a little astray to one side the second optical sensor will be able to still read the ball.\n",
