# Change Up Terminology

## Alliance
A pre-assigned grouping of two (2) *Teams* that are paired together during a given Match.

## Alliance Home Row
The three (3) *Goals* in each Alliance’s Home Zone.

## Alliance Station
The designated regions where the *Drive Team Members* must remain for the duration
of the Match. 

## Autonomous Line
The pair of white tape lines that run across the center of the field. Per ***SG2***,
Robots may not contact the foam field tiles on the opposite Alliance’s side of the Autonomous Line
during the Autonomous Period.

## Autonomous Period
A fifteen second (0:15) period in which Robots operate and react only to sensor inputs and to commands pre-programmed by the Students into the Robot's Control System.

## Connected Row
A Row where all three (3) Goals in the Row are Owned by the same Alliance. 

## Disablement
A penalty applied to a Team for a rule violation. A Team that is Disabled is not allowed to
operate their Robot for the remainder of the Match, and the Drive Team Members will be asked to place
their controller(s) on the ground.

## Disqualification
A penalty applied to a Team for a rule violation. A Team that is Disqualified in a Qualification Match receives zero (0) Win Points, Autonomous Win Point, Autonomous Points, and Strength of
Schedule Points. When a Team is Disqualified in an Elimination Match, the entire Alliance is Disqualified
and they receive a loss for the Match. At the Head Referee’s discretion, repeated violations and Disqualifications for a single Team may lead to its Disqualification for the entire tournament.

## Drive Team Members
A Student who stands in the Alliance Station during a Match for each Team. Only Drive Team Members are permitted to stand in the Alliance Station and allowed to touch the controls during the Match or interact with the Robot. Adults are not allowed to be Drive Team Members.

## Entanglement
A Robot status. A Robot is Entangled if it has grabbed, hooked, or attached to an
opposing Robot or a Field Element.

## Field Element
The foam field tiles, field perimeter, white tape, *Goals*, and all supporting structures and accessories.

## Match Affecting
A rule violation status determined by the head referee. A rule violation is Match
Affecting if it changes the winning and losing Alliances in the Match. Multiple rule violations within a
Match can cumulatively become Match Affecting.

## Owned
A *Goal* is considered *Owned* by an Alliance if its colored *Ball* is the vertically
highest *Scored Ball* in that *Goal*. 

## Possession
A Robot is considered to be Possessing a Ball if a Ball is in an unscored position and any
one of the following criteria are met:
- The Robot is carrying, holding or controlling the movement of a Ball such that if the Robot changes direction, the Ball will move with the Robot. Pushing/plowing Balls is not considered Possession, however using concave portions of your Robot to control the movement of Balls is considered
Possession.
- The Robot is blocking opposing Robots’ access to Balls, such as by expanding horizontally and restricting access to a portion of the field (e.g. a “wallbot”).
- Robots on the same Alliance working in tandem to block access to Balls would share the Possession of the Balls.
See ***SG8*** for more details regarding Possession limits

## Preload
The Ball, one (1) per Robot, that must be placed on the field such that it satisfies the conditions
in ***SG1*** prior to the start of the Match. 

## Row
Three (3) Goals that make up a straight line. There are a total of eight (8) *Rows* including two (2)
Alliance Home Rows. 

## Scored
A *ball* is considered *Scored* in a *Goal* if it is not touching a Robot of the same color as the Ball and meets all of the following criteria
    - The *Ball* is fully or partially within the outer edge of the *Goal*.
    - The *Ball* is fully below the upper edge of the *Goal*
    - The *Ball* is not contacting the foam tiles outside of the *Goal*.

## Traping
A Robot status. A Robot is Trapping if it has restricted an opposing Robot into a small,
confined area of the field, approximately the size of one foam field tile or less, and has not provided an
avenue for escape. Trapping can be direct (e.g. pinning an opponent to a field perimeter wall) or indirect
(e.g. preventing a Robot from escaping from a corner of the field). 
- If a Robot is not attempting to escape, that Robot has not been Trapped.
