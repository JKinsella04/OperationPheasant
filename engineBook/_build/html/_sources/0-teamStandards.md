# 9447H Team Standards

We have standards that we follow when doing anything and everything for robotics. For Building we follow the Engineering Design Process.

<img src="../../images/beginning/designProcess.png" alt="designProcess.png" style="width: 500px;"/>

This photo accurately represents the general Engingeering Process, but we can explain it more specifically. 
During the *Research Ideas/Explore Possibilities* phase we will look at vexforum.com and reveal videos publicly posted on youtube to see if/what kinds of solutions have been published regarding the problem. During the *Make a Model or Prototype* phase we will first make a CAD of the idea to figure out the idea completley before spending resources on it. After this we will make the physical prototype. 

When programming we follow a routine we created called the **Whiteboard Routine**
- First you write what you want to achieve on the whiteboard
- Then begin writing the general logic for that problem on the whiteboard
- Then we transfer the logic from the whiteboard to PROS and download the code to the robot
- Next, we Debug the code by logging what it achieves and doesn't achieve on the whiteboard
- Rewrite any new logic on the whiteboard and then into the program.
- Finally we repeat the last two points until the code achieves what we want.
