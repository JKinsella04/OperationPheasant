    "During the *Research Ideas/Explore Possibilities* phase we will look at vexforum.com and reveal videos publicly posted on youtube to see if/what kinds of solutions have been published regarding the problem. During the *Make a Model or Prototype* phase we will first make a CAD of the idea to figure out the idea completley before spending resources on it. After this we will make the physical prototype. \n",

    "When programming we follow a routine we created called the **Whiteboard Routine**\n",
    "- First you write what you want to achieve on the whiteboard\n",
    "- Then begin writing the general logic for that problem on the whiteboard\n",
    "- Then we transfer the logic from the whiteboard to PROS and download the code to the robot\n",
    "- Next, we Debug the code by logging what it achieves and doesn't achieve on the whiteboard\n",
    "- Rewrite any new logic on the whiteboard and then into the program.\n",
    "- Finally we repeat the last two points until the code achieves what we want."
