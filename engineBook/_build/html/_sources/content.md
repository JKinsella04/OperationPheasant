# Pre-Season Stuff
https://www.roboticseducation.org/documents/2019/08/judge-guide.pdf/#page43

Example page
-example of how all pages will be formatted and shows the user how to read the notebook 

Change up game description;
-feild pic above
-summary of the game and the objective of the game

Game elements and objects
-diagrams of the elements and objects, the sizes and weights, and maybe how they are used

Change up Feild overview
-Just the 6x6 feild diagrams I do with the corresponding notes for each one (look in old notebooks if you don’t know what that is)

Scoring stuff
-Just a table of Point values and then how you score points
-auton points and the mention the home row tic tac toe stuff that’s going on

Change up competition match overview

Initial Thoughts on the Change Up challenge 
-whatever we think

Design brief

Team intro

Key for diagrams

Motor page?

Thoughts about the game (rough)

Auto very important
Need to be able to descore
Holding more than 5 balls in pointless (unless you are hoarding)
Balls scored in the beginning of match will be descored 
Goals are not very tall
Skills change is weird but important for high scoring skill runs it’s important to have quicker, high scoring matches this year, especially if we use a skills run that other teams can easily match in score

Thoughts about the game (refined)

Because of the advantages that autonomous gives you we need to spend a lot of time programming this season

Mecanum is most equal drive base
X-Drive is most manoeuvrable 
Omni isn't resistant to pushing which can be a problem with this games defence
Omni and traction is normally used when you need to save motors and we have more than enough motors most of the design we are prototyping

Tray bot
3-6
3/5
Can hold many balls by unfolding
Can not score and descore at the same time
Snail
3-4
4/5
Can descore and score at the exact same time
Holds limited balls
Tiny Boi

Compact fast drive base
Carries very little amount of balls







Initial Goals for Change Up


Short Term goals;
Design a robot with CAD 
The robot design must be able to score and de-score balls in goals
Research different designs that have worked in the past and adjust them to work with balls
Create pseudocode for future robot
Create Classes for the critical functions of the robot (drive base, arm, Intakes)
Begin strategizing 15 sec autons
Begin strategizing skills auton

Long Term Goals;
Win multiple worlds qualifying awards at the south carolina state competition
Win the majority of excellence, skills, and tournament champions awards at competitions we  attend
Do well in qualifications to choose a strong teammate in finals
Do well in skills to be eligible for excellence 
Have a high scoring auton that gets the home row and beats the majority of teams inside of South Carolina

Design Brainstorming 

Problem Statement; The challenge of Change Up is to score balls in goals, and connect rows of owned goals to gain more points than the opposing alliance at the end of the match.

Design Statement; Design, build, test, and compete with a robot capable of efficiently scoring and de-scoring balls in Vex Robotics Competition, Change Up

Design Constraints; 
The robot must not exceed 18’’ by 18” by 18” before the start of a match
There is a limit of eight (8) V5 motors per robot
No custom parts are allowed on the robot

Robot Criteria;
Must be capable of scoring balls inside of the goals
Must be capable of de-scoring balls from the bottom of goals

Robot Components (ideas);
Drive base resistant to pushing with strafing capabilities
Fast intakes to easily collect balls off the ground, and to easily de-score ball from goals
Lift design, a tray that can hold at least 6 balls and elevate the tray to at least 18.3” (the height of the goals)
