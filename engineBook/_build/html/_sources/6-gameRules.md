# Change Up Game Rules

## SG1 
Starting a Match. Prior to the start of each Match, the Robot must be placed such that it is:
1. Contacting its Home Zone.
2. Not contacting the gray foam field tiles outside of the Alliance’s Home Zone.
3. Not contacting any Balls other than the Preload.
4. Not contacting another Robot.
5. Contacting exactly one (1) Preload.
6. The Preload must be contacting exactly one (1) Robot.
    - The Preload must be fully within the field perimeter.
    - The Preload must not be breaking the vertical projection of the Goal, i.e. the Preload must not be inside or above the Goal.

## SG2
Stay on your side in Autonomous. During the Autonomous Period, Robots may not contact the
foam tiles or Balls which are on the opposing Alliance’s side of the Autonomous Line. Robots may not
contact the Goals that are in the opposing Alliance’s Home Zone.
Violations of this rule will result in the Autonomous Bonus being awarded to the opposing Alliance.
Intentional, strategic, or egregious violations, such as intentional contact with an opposing Robot while
completely across the Autonomous Line, will result in a Disqualification.
- The three (3) Goals contacting the Autonomous Line are not considered to be on either side,
and may be utilized by either Alliance during the Autonomous Period. If attempting to utilize these
Goals, Teams should be cognizant of the possibility that opponent Robots may attempt to do the same.


## SG3
Keep Balls on your side in Autonomous. Balls that start fully on one side of the Autonomous
Line may not contact the foam tiles on the opposite side of the Autonomous Line during the Autonomous Period.
Incidental violations of this rule and have no impact on the opposing Alliance will result in a Warning.
Violations of this rule that affect the opposing Alliance’s autonomous routine will result in the Autonomous Bonus being awarded to the opposing Alliance. Examples of affecting the opposing Alliance could
include, but are not limited to, a Ball moving another Ball or getting in the path of a Robot.
- Balls that start on the Autonomous Line are not included in this rule.

## SG4
Keep Game Objects to yourself. Robots may not intentionally drop or place Game Objects on
an opponent Robot.
Minor violations of this rule that do not affect the Match will result in a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion. 

## SG5
Balls may not be de-scored from the top of Goals. Balls that are Scored may not be lifted by
any means such that the Ball goes above the top edge of the Goal.
It is expected that while removing Balls from the bottom of the Goal, this may cause the top Ball to
momentarily go above the top edge of the Goal. This would not be a violation of this rule and is considered to be normal game play.
If the Match ends while a Robot is removing a Ball from the bottom of the Goal that contains three
(3) Balls and the top Ball remains partially above the top edge of the Goal, that Ball will be considered
Scored and no penalty to the Team will be assessed.
Minor violations of this rule that do not affect the Match will result in a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion.

## SG6
Keep Balls in the field. Teams may not intentionally remove Balls from the field. While Balls
may accidentally leave the field when attempting to Score, doing so intentionally or repeatedly would
be a violation of this rule. Balls that leave the field during Match play, intentionally or unintentionally,
will be returned to the field at the location nearest the point at which they exited. Referees will return
the Balls to the field when it is deemed safe to do so, at the leisure of the referee.
Minor violations of this rule that do not affect the Match will result in a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a
Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion.

## SG7
Use Balls to play the game. Balls may not be used to accomplish actions that would be
otherwise illegal if they were attempted by Robot mechanisms (e.g., Interfering with an opponent’s
Autonomous Period per ***SG2***.)
> The intent of this rule is to prohibit teams from using game objects as “gloves” to loophole any rule that
states “a Robot may not [do some action]”. This rule is not intended to be taken in its most extreme
literal interpretation, where any interaction between a Ball and a Robot needs to be scrutinized with the
same intensity as if it were a Robot. 

## SG8
Possession is limited. Robots may not have greater-than-momentary Possession of more than
three (3) Balls of its opposing Alliance’s color at once. When two Robots from the same Alliance are
working in tandem and blocking Balls, those Robots may not possess a total of more than six (6) Balls
of its opposing Alliance’s color at once.
Robots that violate this rule must stop all Robot actions except for those actions that are attempting to
remove the excess Ball.
Minor violations of this rule that are not Match Affecting will receive a warning. Match Affecting
offenses will result in a Disqualification. Teams that receive multiple warnings may also receive a
Disqualification at the Head Referee’s discretion.
> The overarching intent of this rule is to prohibit each Robot from keeping more than 3 of the opposing
Balls from being used by the opposing Alliance.
One definition of Possession is “blocking opposing Robots’ access to Balls, such as by expanding horizontally and restricting access to a portion of the field (e.g. a ”wallbot”).” Put simply - as far as Possession is concerned, a defensive “wallbot” does not violate ***SG8***, as long as 3 or more of the offensive
Alliance’s Balls are not being blocked.
Similarly, if two Robots work in tandem to prevent access to an opposing Alliance’s Balls, they are not
in violation of ***SG8*** as long as they are not blocking access to more than 6 of the opposing Alliance’s
Balls in total, and each Robot is not carrying or controlling more than 3 Balls each.
